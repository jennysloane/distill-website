# Building Websites in R with Distill 

In August 2022, I presgave a webinar to the R-Oman Users group on buildling websites using the `distill` package in R. This was a completely interactive talk where we went through and created a website from scratch. By the end of the talk, we had a functioning and live website hosted through GitHub.

This repository is actually the repository that I created during the talk to build the website! 

I've also added the PowerPoint slides to the repo for anyone who is interested.

# Additional Resources

There is only so much we could cover in an hour long talk, but here is a YouTube series I've been working on over the last couple of months to help you on your journey to creating and designing your distill website:
